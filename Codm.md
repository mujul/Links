Sure! Here’s a **weapon score table** for the loadouts, taking into account factors like **Mobility**, **Accuracy**, **Range**, **Control**, **Fire Rate**, and **Recoil** for each weapon, based on their attributes.

### **Weapon Score Table:**

### **Key Notes:**

1.  **Mobility**: Higher mobility generally means faster movement, which is vital for both close-range combat and repositioning.
2.  **Accuracy**: Determines how well the weapon performs at mid-to-long range, as well as its ability to hit targets consistently.
3.  **Range**: The effective range at which the weapon can deal significant damage.
4.  **Control**: A higher control rating indicates that the weapon is easier to handle with less recoil, improving accuracy in sustained fire.
5.  **Fire Rate**: How fast the weapon can fire, which impacts its damage output in close-range or sustained fire fights.
6.  **Recoil**: A lower recoil value makes it easier to control the weapon during sustained fire, especially with full-auto guns.

### **Total Score Calculation:**

-   I’ve combined all factors for each weapon, with the highest values assigned based on performance. The higher the total score, the better the weapon performs overall.
-   The **Fennec**, **CBR4**, and **Locus** come out on top with the highest scores, thanks to a combination of good mobility, accuracy, and fire rate.

These scores are estimates based on weapon attributes, and in practice, individual performance can vary depending on playstyle and attachment setups.
